# This is my first blog post

Over the past, I've tried multiple free blog sites, but I never continue using/adding stuff to it. Maybe that's because
I didn't like those websites, or maybe it was who my own personal failure. Anyway, why I tried now (again), with GitHub
static hosting is because I really liked the web-based installation/operation guide that I helped prepare for my
customer. So, here I am, trying the same for my personal use. I don't know if I keep doing this in the coming years, but
let's hope for the best.

Sorry, this post is not so colorful/informative/attractive as I want it to be but moving on, as I learn things, I'll
keep evolving.
