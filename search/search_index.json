I like solving problems, mainly for network-security related ones. I really love doing it. I have a strong background in Networking and Network Security context in general, so I solve (or I try to) problems related to those areas. Just like anybody else, I don't know everything. So, I live and I learn.</p> <p>Back in my University days, I have studied Electronics and Telecommunication engineering at the University of Moratuwa. I always had a curiosity to know and learn how machines talk and how we use machines to talk, so I focused more on Telecommunication side of my degree. Even for the final-year project I did a simulation of Vehicular communication (V2X) by using OMNet++ and SUMO. I have always wished that I would do post-graduate studies in that area but here I am, learn, design, and troubleshoot computer networks. It doesn't matter, I like doing this job too.</p> <p>So, after my university career, I started my first job at a Systems-Integration Company in Sri Lanka (Millennium IT ESP). Starting from the ground, I have learned Network Switching, Routing, and Security areas there. Good thing about working for a SI company in Sri Lanka is that I get to work with customer from start to finish. Meaning, starting from initial discussions, PoC (Proof of Concept), information gathering, to delivering the project, and finally do hand-over and a KT (Knowledge Transfer), I got to do everything. It may sound pretty-bad, but I really loved doing it. What I see the best part of doing that job is because I get to know the problem and work for a solution, which I think is what engineering is all about. </p> <p>Anyway, time has passed and here I am now, working for Fortinet, undoubtedly the best cybersecurity company out there, in Malaysia, living with my wife and daughter. I think I have acquired more knowledge over the years, doing work, so now it's time to write some back. Maybe someone out there will read this someday, or maybe I read it someday and see my own progress, and see how blessed I am.</p> <p>In this site, I'll try to add all my lessons, failures, tests, and ideas. It's gonna be fun :)</p>"},{"location":"blog/index.html","title":"Blogs","text":""},{"location":"blog/2025/07/22/this-is-my-first-blog-post.html","title":"This is my first blog post","text":"<p>Over the past, I've tried multiple free blog sites, but I never continue using/adding stuff to it. Maybe that's because I didn't like those websites, or maybe it was who my own personal failure. Anyway, why I tried now (again), with GitHub static hosting is because I really liked the web-based installation/operation guide that I helped prepare for my customer. So, here I am, trying the same for my personal use. I don't know if I keep doing this in the coming years, but let's hope for the best.</p> <p>Sorry, this post is not so colorful/informative/attractive as I want it to be but moving on, as I learn things, I'll keep evolving.</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025.html","title":"2025","text":""}]}
